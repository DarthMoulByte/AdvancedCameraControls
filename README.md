# AdvancedCamera
Advanced RTS-like camera features such as zoom-to-point using RxNET

# Features
* Zoom in/out to a point ( mouse position in this case )
* Rotate around point of origin ( with clamping )
* Right click drag/pan that respects raycast's height ( doesn't jump when moving on uneven terrain )
* Left click for orbital rotation

# Why did you make this?
I've created this due to lack of proper camera controls available on the web.

The "zoom-in-and-out to a point" feature is probably what you're looking for, eventhough this may seem like a simple task, it has a handful of challenges.
As for orbital rotation, this one I wouldn't call it a perfect implementation but it's was also one hell of a challenge.

This project is for all the poor souls who're looking for advanced control solution. Take it as an inspiration.
